[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/User/Repo.svg)]
(https://jitpack.io/#JoeyOggie/utilities)

A collection of utilities and sample methods I re-use in different projects. Some of them are not by me.

Instructions:
Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}

Step 2. Add the dependency

	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.joeyoggie:utilities:v1.3'
	}
